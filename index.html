If we intend to apply the modifications or amendments to this Privacy Policy retroactively or to personal information already in our possession, we will provide you with notice of the modifications or amendments.
Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy apply only to information gathered by us through our Services.

This Privacy Policy covers our use of any information that can or could be used to identify you (“Personal Data”).
We may collect and use the following Personal Data to provide the Services to you and fulfill the Terms:
- When you sign up for our Services you give us Personal Data voluntarily by providing it to us, for example when you sign up for an account. We collect and use that information in order to authenticate you when you register an account and use the Services, to make sure you are eligible and able to receive the Services, and so that you receive the correct version of the Services. Depending on which of the Services you use, that may include your name, mailing address, phone number, residency, gender, date of birth (as needed to verify eligibility), and email address. We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Service, including at account creation and registration, newsletter sign-up forms, “contact us” forms, or when you otherwise interact with the Service. We use that information to fulfill those Services to you and to provide related customer support to you.
- As a general policy, no personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, or e-mail address, is automatically collected from your visit to the Sites or download and install the Apps. However, we may automatically and passively collect and use certain information from your device whenever you visit, use, or interact with our Service, including: the Internet Protocol address (IP address) of the machine which accessed the Services, general location information, the date and time of your visit, the path taken through the Services, content preferences, the browser and operating system being used, a list of files downloaded or viewed, the amount of time spent accessing files, any errors encountered, crash reports which may be automatically generated when or if our Services crash and includes information about the system and the crash, and other similar data.
- You also give us Personal Data when you make a purchase through us, subscribe to our publications or Subscriptions, or communicate with us. Providing this information is completely voluntary on your part; however, it may be required to use or access some of our Services and Subscriptions. For example, if you choose to contact us via email, we may retain your email and email address along with any other associated information. Doing so is completely voluntary on your part, and you have the choice about whether and what information to disclose via your email.
- We may use third-party vendors to process online payments and provide platforms for us to provide you with the Content and Services. If we utilize such vendors, the third-party payment vendor will collect payment and other personal information (such as your payment card information, email address, mobile phone number, billing and shipping address) to complete your purchases, but only with your permission. The vendor may also use cookies to track your activity and for other purposes. The third-party vendor that provides the platform for the Content and Services, as applicable, may collect, use, disclose, store, process, and transfer personally-identifiable information when you interact with its services through the Services. This vendor may also use cookies to track your activity and other purposes. Move Feel Heal, nor David Starbuck Smith is not responsible for, and assumes no liability for, the privacy and information collection and use practices of these or any other third-party vendors. Please review the third-parties privacy and other applicable policies carefully. If you do not agree to the collection and use of this information by our third-party vendors, please do not use the online payment, message or comment features, and not use access the Content.
- We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Service with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you.
- In addition, please note, our Services may use third-party platforms to access the Services and/or we may provide third party interfaces or links on the Service to facilitate your sending a communication from the Service. When you use these third-party platforms, the third-party platforms may or may not provide us with information about you. We are not responsible for the terms, policies, disclosures or actions of any third-party platforms.
- Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address, phone number) on bulletin boards, social medial, comments sections, in feedback to us, or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other people. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances. You acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of any user generated content or communications, including without limitation e-mail, chat, text, or voice communications. Because voice, chat, text, and other communications and user generated content may be viewed and/or heard by other users, users should avoid revealing any personally identifiable information in those communications.
- We may collect certain personal information from you during the course of our normal business operations if you do business with us and/or are employed by us. For example, we may collect certain personal information about you (such as, without limitation, name, email address, date of birth, address, and phone number) either directly from you or from your representative, or from third parties authorized by you.
